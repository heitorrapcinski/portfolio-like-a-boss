## Glossary

MVS. Multiple Virtual Storage.

MVS/ESA. Multiple Virtual Storage/Enterprise Systems Architecture.

DASD. direct access storage device.

DASD volume. A DASD space identified by a common label and accessed by a set of related addresses. See volume.

Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF). A dialog manager for interactive applications. It provides control and services to permit execution of dialogs.

Open Systems Adapter (OSA). An integrated IBM mainframe hardware feature that combines the functions of an I/O channel with the functions of a network port to provide direct connectivity between mainframe applications and their clients on the attached network.

SMP/E. System Modification Program/Extended.

SNA network interconnection (SNI). The connection, by gateways, of two or more independent SNA networks to allow communication between logical units in those networks. The individual SNA networks retain their independence.

LPAR. logically partitioned (mode).

IPL. initial program load.

SDSF. System Display and Search Facility.

Resource Access Control Facility (RACF). An IBM security manager product that provides for access control by identifying and verifying the users to the system, authorizing access to protected resources, logging the detected unauthorized attempts to enter the system and logging the detected accesses to protected resources. See IBM Security Server.

PARMLIB. All the members in the SYS1.PARMLIB data set that contain parameters setting the limits and controlling the behavior of z/OS.

PARMLIB MEMBER. A member in the SYS1.PARMLIB data set.

VTAM. Virtual Telecommunications Access Method.

VSAM. virtual storage access method.

z/Architecture. An IBM architecture for mainframe computers and peripherals. The zSeries family of servers uses the z/Architecture.

z/OS. A widely used operating system for IBM mainframe computers that uses 64-bit central storage.

z/OS Language Environment. An IBM software product that provides a common runtime environment and common runtime services for conforming high-level language compilers.

z/OS UNIX System Services (z/OS UNIX). z/OS services that support a UNIX-like environment. Users can switch between the traditional TSO/E interface and the shell interface. UNIX-skilled users can interact with the system, using a familiar set of standard commands and utilities. z/OS-skilled users can interact with the system, using familiar TSO/E commands and interactive menus to create and manage hierarchical file system files and to copy data back and forth between z/OS data sets and files. Application programmers and users have both sets of interfaces to choose from and, by making appropriate trade-offs, can choose to mix these interfaces.

zAAP. zSeries Application Assist Processor.

zFS. zSeries file system.

zSeries. IBM enterprise servers based on z/Architecture.

zSeries Application Assist Processor (zAAP). A specialized processing assist unit configured for running Java programming on selected zSeries machines.

zSeries File System (zFS). A z/OS UNIX file system that stores files in VSAM linear data sets.

CP. (1) central processor. (2) control point.

ABEND. abnormal end.

TSO. Time-sharing option. See Time Sharing Option/ Extensions (TSO/E).

TSO/E. Time Sharing Option/Extensions.
