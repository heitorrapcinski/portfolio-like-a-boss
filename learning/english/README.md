## ARGUMENTATIVE AND ADVICE-GIVING STRATEGIES
>Inter 3 pages 253, 263
>
- Argumentation 
    - Based on research, analysis, and critical view on the topic.
    - Not only exposes the topic but also the writer’s point of view. 
    - The writer or speaker defends the point of view using data as support.
    - Usually written in the third person. 
- Structure of an Argumentative Essay
    - Introduction → Presents the main idea and conflict in one paragraph.
    - Development → Three paragraphs with exposition of ideas and solutions of conflicts.
    - Conclusion → Wraps up the text. No new ideas can appear in this part of the text.
- Argumentation Essay in Spoken Language
    - The conversation must also be complete: beginning, middle, and end.
    - The conversation only ends once the argument is based on evidence.
    - If the strategies and steps aren’t followed, probably there will be questions to gather extra information and then the audience will reach a conclusion
- Argumentative Strategies
    - There are some resources and techniques one can follow to expose data and support opinion convincingly.
    - Analyzing Pros and Cons
        - Taking into consideration positive and negative aspects helps make a reasonable analysis in your speech or text. They will also help you reach a conclusion, so you can structure your text like this: 
        - Paragraph 1 – Introduction 
        - Paragraph 2 – Positive aspects 
        - Paragraph 3 – Negative aspects 
        - Paragraph 4 – Evaluation of both positive and negative aspects
        - Paragraph 5 – Conclusion
    - Rhetorical Strategies
        - 1. Appeal to logic or reason, usually through inductive or deductive reasoning. 
            - The writer or speaker must be careful not to use fallacies, which are oversimplification of logic. 
                - Jack is a boy. Jack is violent. All boys are violent. (This is a fallacy.)
        - 2. Deal with the character, credibility, and reliability of the writer. Actions like choosing reliable sources, respecting the reader/listener, organizing ideas in the text and proofreading.
        - 3. Deal with the readers’ emotions. It shows the writer or speaker is connected with the reader by making their text more personal and in ways that the recipient can relate. 
    - Quotations
        - There are different techniques to use quotations in writing. Direct quotations are extracts of an author's work or opinion, copied between quotes (""), followed by credits to the original author. 
        - In academic writing, there are set rules of direct quotations whose reference (author and source of research) will appear in the footnote. 
        - Indirect quotations don’t usually come between quotes but are usually introduced by phrases that indicate you’re about to quote someone:
            - According to (name of the author)... 
            - As (name of the author) states...
            - As stated by (name of the author)...
            - (Name of the author) states that...
        - **Important Note**: The use of an author's words, even if paraphrased, without due credit is what constitutes plagiarism (appropriation of one's work and ideas taking them as one's own). It is considered an ethical foul and undermines the credibility of an author for good. 
    - Paraphrase
        - Paraphrases can be explained by the chunk of language "in other words." When you paraphrase an extract or an idea, you say the same thing with different words. The original author must be credited as well. 
            - René Descartes said: I think, therefore I am. 
            - Paraphrase – For René Descartes, rationality defines men. 
    - Summary
        - Summaries are a short version of an original text that concentrates on its main idea, leaving out details, and written with your own words. Again, the original author must be credited. 
        - Romeo and Juliet, tragedy written by William Shakespeare, narrates a tragic love story of a couple from diverging families in ancient Verona 
    - Narrations
        - Narrations can be used as means to exemplify the author’s point related to data collected during research. These narrations, if based on the author’s experience, don’t need to be credited. 
        - René Descartes believed that rationality defines men and that seems to be true since intellectuals are the ones who define the principles that guide our society as we learn at school.
    - Remember that no argumentation is made without support, so, you can justify your conclusions using connectors and indicating references.
        - Human beings must be careful when killing animals because they balance the environment, according to...
- Advice-giving Strategies
    - Using Commands (Imperative)
        - The use of Imperatives to give advice is a common resource. It is important to mind your tone of voice when using it. 
        - Examples
